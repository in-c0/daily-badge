# 🌟 Daily Fun Message Badge

Get a cute, quirky, uplifting message on your GitHub profile — refreshed daily ✨



## 💖 How to Use

Just add this to your `README.md`:

```markdown
![Daily Badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://in-c0.github.io/daily-badge/badge.json&style=for-the-badge)
```


To display this badge on your GitHub profile, add it to the `README.md` of the profile repo, i.e. a repo named exactly after your username.
 
### 🕒 Optional: Customize timezone

To change when your daily message updates, modify `timezone.txt` with a timezone from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), e.g. `Australia/Sydney`
